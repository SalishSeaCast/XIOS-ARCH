Quick Usage
===========

* If you are a member of the SalishSeaCast organization on GitHub,
  clone the https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/XIOS-2 repository,
  otherwise,
  check out the XIOS source code from the  http://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/ioserver/ SVN repository

* Clone this repository beside your XIOS checkout

* Symlink the ``arch-*`` files for the system that you are working on into the
  ``XIOS/arch/`` directory.
  For example, on ``sockeye.arc.ubc.ca``, symlink each of the ``UBC-ARC/arch-GCC_SOCKEYE.*``
  into the ``XIOS/arch/`` directory.

* Build XIOS with ``./make_xios``.
  For example, on ``sockeye``, use ``./make_xios --arch GCC_SOCKEYE --job 8``

Please see the SalishSeaCast NEMO `quick start guide`_ for the system that you are working on
